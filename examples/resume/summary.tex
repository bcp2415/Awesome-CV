\begin{cvparagraph}

%---------------------------------------------------------
Former teacher and academic researcher moving into software development.  About to graduate from LaunchCode's LC101 with full-stack training in JavaScript and Java.  Began by falling in love with LaTeX and Vim in grad school, then recently drawn into coding through self-study, side projects, and LaunchCode.  Strong communication and analytic skills, careful and able to obsess over details.  I love delivering value, working on teams, and learning new skills.
